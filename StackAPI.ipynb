Practically it would just be too much work.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince NTFS file system has the so called slack space I would rather wipe the whole drive if that information is so critical.

Do you think this is possible? or maybe you have some better suggestions. I am very confused as I have only recently first heard about MS Access at all, so any help is greatly appreciated.',\n",

The driver was coded so that when you reached the edge of the physical screen, the driver panned the virtual desktop across the physical screen. On the Matrox cards, this was known as &#39;Virtual Desktop&#39;. Here is a link or two that references the feature...\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.matrox.com/graphics/media/pdf/support/manuals/en_inst.pdf\\r\\n\\r\\nThis link is for the Mac driver, but explains the feature better than the PDF above...\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.matrox.com/graphics/media/pdf/support/manuals/en_mac2.pdf\\r\\n\\r\\nI&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know how to configure this for later Windows versions either. However, I too am searching for it, since I think that combined with a set of VR glasses, having the pan feature triggered when you move your head from left to right could be a very natural way to pan around a desktop that is wider than your display device.',\n",

Almost completely data driven.

Should be a codebase - not a Saas - e.g. - a system to be installed on a server.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Generally the behavior (aside from profiles, setting etc.) - is where users can create a list of products (or other records - for instance &quot;recipes&quot;, or &quot;workout plan&quot;) - i.e. some kind of packaged &#39;product&#39; posted by a user. - that other users can view and ‘transact’ with (buy, subscribe, etc.).  \\r\\n\\r\\nNot wanting an ecommerce system, nor do I want to use a generic CMS.

Maybe the issues I had have been solved with the update?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n- iOS UI compatibility, only to give an example: I was using **ListView** to display a list of elements with variable height. On Android the result was always fine, but completely messed up on iOS.\\r\\n- iOS export issues. Not having a Mac I can&#39;t properly test and build the app to be published in App Store. \\r\\n- Performance. Of course cross developed apps aren&#39;t as fast as native ones, but it&#39;s still a requirement to find the best alternative.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo did Xamarin improve this points since the 2017 version? Or should I look somewhere else&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my researches I found good alternatives in Flutter and React Native, but it will imply learning a new language plus using a new IDE.

I hope it&#39;s not seen as a duplicate. If it is, my apologies in advance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI&#39;m looking for an application fullfilling the following criteria:\\r\\n\\r\\n1-As the title mentions, I want to create non-linear presentations. This means the ability, from any given state of the presentation, to freely choose to move to one of a set of possible alternatives. I&#39;m really interested in having this done by moving a camera, and zooming in and out like Prezi does.\\r\\n\\r\\n2-I&#39;d like the created presentations to be portable. This would mean either having the presentation viewer to be cross-platform or be webbrowser-based. However, I simultaneously require the presentation viewer (and if possible the presentation creator) to be useable offline.\\r\\n\\r\\n3-I require the software to be free.\\r\\n\\r\\n4-I require the editor to be WYSIWYG since my fluency in programming languages is limited, and have no extra time to invest on that ATM (however, having an optional programming interface would be nice for when, in the future, I make some time for learn whatever programming language is required).',\n",

You can pre-load the stored clips by editing the `~/.cache/xfce4/clipman/textsrc` file before starting clipman, and even peudo-freeze it by clicking &quot;disable&quot; (in a right-click checkbox) to stop it from adding new copied items.\\r\\n\\r\\n [![clipman example image][1]][1]\\r\\n\\r\\n- [AutoKey](https://code.google.com/archive/p/autokey/) ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoKey) or [packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/sid/autokey-gtk)) might be useful too.\\r\\n\\r\\n &gt;AutoKey is a desktop automation utility for Linux and X11. It allows you to manage collection of scripts and phrases, and assign abbreviations and hotkeys to these. This allows you to execute a script or insert text on demand in whatever program you are using.\\r\\n\\r\\n &gt;AutoKey features a subset of the capabilities of the popular Windows-based AutoHotkey, but is not intended as a full replacement. For a Linux-based implementation of AutoHotkey, see IronAHK. AutoKey&#39;s GUI features a number of concepts and features inspired by the Windows program PhraseExpress.\\r\\n\\r\\n- A web browser might have it&#39;s own form autofill feature, but an extension might autofill forms even better, like [Autofill for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autofill/nlmmgnhgdeffjkdckmikfpnddkbbfkkk?hl=en).\\r\\n\\r\\n &gt;Form autofill on steroids.\\r\\n\\r\\n &gt;The Autofill extension serves one purpose: fill form fields automatically on page load without any user interaction. This is its primary function, but it can do so much more. Chrome has a built-in autofill feature, but it doesn&#39;t work on all fields and requires you to select from a drop-down menu. Even if you&#39;re happy with Chrome&#39;s autofill, give this extension a try for more automation and power at your fingertips.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/okAdD.png',\n",

I have seen some catalog programs that will do this but they are too interactive. Our clients don&#39;t want to edit the move the files around or convert them into something else. \\r\\nWe aren&#39;t able to use the old program anymore. The new program we have doesn&#39;t have ability to create the CD or flash drive. We can gather the information we need but no way to make a nice interactive interface for the client. I thought someone might know of a piece of software that I could use to make this interface. I thought of doing in HTML but didnt know if the differing drives would cause an issue in reading the information. For example my drive might be letter E and someone else might be J.

(EU has 28 member states + 1-2 hangarounds = 30) Each Country will be divided into five, each subdivision will be further subdivided into five, on and on, reaching ever smaller geographical subdivisions, until we end up at the neighborhood level after roughly 7-9 layers or so (depending on the EU country).\\r\\n\\r\\nEach geography will have a leader and a set of function officers, and a set of deputies, for a total of 15 people. Each geography leader will have the responsibility of assigning the geography&#39;s function officers, as well as adding geography leaders for the subdivisions right under his/her geography. The map will lag a bit after reality, and the only people who gets assigned are people who have stepped up and are already doing the work. Once someone has a de facto position, they get asked for consent and then added to the map. Volunteers will be able to go to this map whenever they are in need of help, and find the go to person for their need.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo put this in technical terms, I will need a diagram software that can handle a shit ton of entities (10-50 Million) without lagging, being shareable and editable by 10k people+.\\r\\nI run on a shoestring budget, and can&#39;t expect a lot of technical competence from the leaders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nodes needs to have configurable default names/values (since each EU country is different and have different languages) that you can set in one central place, updating all the nodes.

       "   'body_markdown': 'If you&#39;re doing image processing, you&#39;re probably using OpenCV, which [has support](https://opencv.org/platforms/) for Android since 2010 and iOS since 2012. [`react-native-opencv`](https://github.com/ma-pe/react-native-opencv) takes advantage of this cross-platform support to propose React Native bindings with this library. [This tutorial](https://brainhub.eu/blog/opencv-react-native-image-processing/) does a step-by-step explanation about how to integrate OpenCV with React Native.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides that, unfortunately, there are not really any JS lib that are optimized for algebraic computation. @kgryte already wrote [an excellent answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44058220/8186898) on Stack Overflow explaining why - I won&#39;t duplicate information, but it basically goes like: there aren&#39;t really any hard technical barrier, but not a lot of people need to do efficient computations in JS, so there aren&#39;t a lot of library doing that, further pushing the dev requiring efficient computations to other languages, and so on - vicious circle!\\r\\n\\r\\nLet&#39;s note that with the rise in popularity of JS, Google has recently made its renowned deep learning library TensorFlow [available in JS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), with NodeJS and browser optimizations. Nothing is precised in the docs about mobile optimizations, I guess for the following reasons (which are also valid for explaining the non-existence of computation-optimized React Native libs):\\r\\n\\r\\n- The mobile is not often viewed as the right place for expensive computations, because of low speed and high battery usage\\r\\n- If mobile JS is used as a webview, there are several layers between the JS and the hardwware (JS / JS engine / Browser / Native layer), each of them slowing down the code\\r\\n- If mobile JS is transpiled to native code, as in React Native, transpilation is often performed at the expense of native API reduction and speed optimizations, both slowing down the code\\r\\n- If an app needs to be fast, it is often directly written in native code, so, no React Native\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a nutshell, there isn&#39;t any JS lib optimized for computation in React Native (besides the ones you precised) because it would be quite a bad developer choice to both require fast computation and the usage of React Native. The only choices that are available to you are React Native bindings for libraries written in native code, like OpenCV.',\n",
